# Cplusplus-Program
This project is a Proof of concept when we were beginning to start coding with C++, this is a very basic clock that we made just testing our knowledge of coding with C++ and basic for loops, this is by no means the pinnacle of what we are able to do with proper knowledge of everything you can do with C++.

When it came to this project I felt that I made it readable with the comments that i added trying to explain what i was thinking at the time of writing it, the only part that isn't as readable is the actually output for the clock when you look at the code as i used alot of std to fix the issues of formatting but looking back on it I probably wouldn't change the code i used as even now the solution i used makes sense to me.

The most challenging thing i had to write for this code was definietly the output for the clocks and making them look correct without using alot of erroneous code that would serve to confuse not only me but anyone that happened to read my code after the fact which is why i found the std setw command to be my best friend when writing my code.

Things that I could see making my code better are, first and foremost a way for the clock to always run in the background thus making it an effective clock that is able to run as its own standalone clock that you can manipulate say like a wristwatch or a microwave clock. 

The skills i had used to write this code may have been basic but they are nonetheless useful in any given situation even as i learn more advanced and useful ways to go about a problem the skills i used for this project are the foundation that i have built even more skills for C++ on and will always be useful as a simple means of writing code or even error checking it in a very simple way
