  - `Project1Clock.cpp`: The main source code file for the clock application.
  - `Project1Clock.sln`: Visual Studio solution file for the project.
  - `Project1Clock.vcxproj`: Visual Studio project file.
  - Additional build and configuration files.

- **10 dos of programming.docx**: A document outlining ten essential best practices in programming.

- **10 dos of programming.png**: An image representation of the ten programming best practices.

- **Module three assignment.png**: An image related to the assignment from module three of the course.

- **README.md**: This README file providing an overview of the repository.

## Project 1: Basic Clock Application

### Objective

The goal of Project 1 is to develop a simple clock application using C++. This project serves as an introduction to C++ programming, focusing on fundamental concepts such as:

- Input and output operations
- Control structures
- Functions
- Basic object-oriented programming principles

### Files

- `Project1Clock.cpp`: Contains the source code for the clock application. The program prompts the user to input the current time and then displays it in a formatted manner.

- `Project1Clock.sln` and `Project1Clock.vcxproj`: These files are used with Microsoft Visual Studio to manage the project. They contain settings and configurations necessary for building and running the application.

### How to Run

1. **Using Visual Studio**:

   - Open the `Project1Clock.sln` file in Visual Studio.
   - Build the solution by selecting **Build > Build Solution**.
   - Run the application by pressing **F5** or selecting **Debug > Start Debugging**.

2. **Using Command Line**:
   - Compile the `Project1Clock.cpp` file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
     ```bash
     g++ -o Project1Clock Project1Clock.cpp
     ```
   - Run the executable:
     ```bash
     ./Project1Clock
     ```

## 10 Dos of Programming

The `10 dos of programming.docx` and `10 dos of programming.png` files provide a list of ten best practices in programming. These guidelines are intended to help developers write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. Key principles include:

1. **Write Readable Code**: Ensure your code is easy to understand by using clear naming conventions and comments.
2. **Keep It Simple**: Avoid unnecessary complexity; strive for simplicity in design and implementation.
3. **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself; reuse code wherever possible to reduce redundancy.
4. **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain a consistent coding style and formatting throughout your codebase.
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to manage exceptions and prevent crashes.
6. **Version Control**: Use version control systems like Git to track changes and collaborate effectively.
7. **Test Thoroughly**: Write and run tests to verify that your code works as intended and to catch bugs early.
8. **Document Your Code**: Provide documentation for your code to explain its functionality and usage.
9. **Optimize Performance**: Write efficient code that optimizes resource usage and execution time.
10. **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated with the latest programming trends, tools, and best practices.
